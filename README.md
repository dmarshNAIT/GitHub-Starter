# Hi!
## Welcome to GitHub! 👋

The point of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with the GitHub workflow.

- [ ] In your local repo, please **create a file** called `AboutMe.md` 📄
- [ ] In this file, **enter as much as you'd like to share with me**: maybe just your name, maybe something you'd like to share about yourself, or hobbies you like, or things you're interested in learning. ✍️
- [ ] **Commit** your file (using a GOOD commit message) and then **push** it to GitHub. 💾
- [ ] Your instructor will take a look and provide you feedback. **When you get this feedback, respond to it** with either a comment or a reaction. 👍


**That's it!** Now you know all you need to submit assessments for this course. ⭐

#

- [ ] Bonus task: you can even **edit this file** to mark each task as complete! This file is in markdown format, so that means all you need to do is replace the space inside each checkbox with an `x`: e.g. `[ ]` becomes `[x]`
